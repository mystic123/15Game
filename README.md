15Game

Technologies:
C++11
Qt5 (GUI)

Easy 15 puzzle game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) with graphic user interface. It uses Qt library for creating GUI and A-star algorithm for solving.

It was my first project with Qt so GUI still has many bugs. Maybe some day I will find time to finish it.
